# Application
Console-based application in C# to parse the stock.csv file.

Program.cs is the main file.

DBManager.cs manages connections to the database and SQL commands.

FileParser.cs parses the file and stores the data in a list of Part objects.

Part.cs is an object to contain parsed data.

# Database
dbo.Parts.sql is the table I used to test the application.
